# What-Makes-People-Happy 

### Description
What predicts happiness? In this project, you’ll use data from Show of Hands, an informal polling platform for use on mobile devices and the web, to see what aspects and characteristics of people’s lives predict happiness. Show of Hands has been downloaded over 300,000 times across Apple and Android app stores, and users have cast more than 75 million votes. In this problem, we’ll use data from thousands of users and one hundred di erent questions to see which responses predict happiness. You can also this problem as a competition in the data science competition platform Kaggle.

### Raw Data Preprocessing
Machine learning algorithms learn from data. However, the data we can actually obtain is not born for learning. Instead, the raw data is usually incorrect, incomplete, improperly formatted, duplicated, or in some even worse cases. It is critical to feed those learning algorithms the right data for the problem we want to solve. Even if we have good data, we need to make sure that it is in a useful scale, format and even that meaningful features are included. Hence, data scrubbing, also called data cleansing, is a very important step to prepare data for a machine learning algorithm. And it generally include the following steps:

* Data analysis* Missing data processing* Outlier processing* Redundant data processing 
* Noisy data processing

Now, let’s focus on the data preprocessing of this project, we mainly focus on "data analysis" and "missing data processing". These two steps are required in this project. More detailed requirements of relevant tasks will be specified in the subsequent parts. However, to pursue better classification and inference performance, you are also encouraged to trying other steps.

### Classification
#### Train Classifiers in Scikit-Learn
* Logistic Regression
